## LABOR REPORT

 A lightweight CLI tool for fetching and graphing KPIs of field technicians at my
 current employer. The script fetches data form Method CRM using the user's API key. The data is processed and stored in JSON.
 Customer reports can easliy be generated through the CLI. Once saved, the report can be viewed again, deleted, or graphed.
